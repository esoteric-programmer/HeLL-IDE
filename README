This is HeLL IDE, an IDE for Malbolge and its low-level assembly language HeLL.

You need Qt (version 4.8 or higher) and QScintilla (version 2.6 or higher) to build HeLL IDE.
You need LMAO (version 0.5 or higher) to assemble, run, and debug your HeLL projects.

Go to the src directory and type "qmake", then "make" to build HeLL IDE.
$ cd src
$ qmake
$ make

If you have built HeLL IDE, then type "./hell-ide" to run HeLL IDE.
Adjust the path to the LMAO binary in the preferences dialog of HeLL IDE.

- Click at Debug->Start to enter the debugging mode.
- The position of the D register is indicated by a yellow arrow,
  the position of the C register is indicated by a green arrow
  (if they point to .DATA or .CODE section).
- At the right side of the HeLL IDE window, you can
  enter expressions that will be evaluated by the debugger.
  Valid expressions are labels of your HeLL program
  (they will be evaluated to the address they are pointing at),
